### Project Description
This project is a YouTube video player with additional features like task management and note-taking. It allows users to paste a valid YouTube URL, which dynamically loads the video into an iframe. Users can save their favorite videos to a list and remove them as needed, with the list stored in localStorage for persistence. The task management feature lets users create, view, and delete tasks for better organization. The note-taking functionality provides a space for users to jot down notes related to the video, helping them keep track of key points or thoughts during video playback.

### The Problem statement
This project aims to address the issue of users saving videos to "Watch Later" or "Liked Videos" without ever revisiting them. By integrating YouTube video playback, task management, and note-taking features, the solution helps users organize saved content, set actionable tasks, and manage time effectively for productive video consumption.
